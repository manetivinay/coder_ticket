# Requires supporting ruby fixtures with custom matchers and macros, etc, in
# spec/support/ and its subdirectories. Files matching `spec/**/*_spec.rb` are
# run as spec fixtures by default. This means that fixtures in spec/support that end
# in _spec.rb will both be required and run as specs, causing the specs to be
# run twice. It is recommended that you do not name fixtures matching this glob to
# end with _spec.rb. You can configure this pattern with the --pattern
# option on the command line or in ~/.rspec, .rspec or `.rspec-local`.
#
# The following line is provided for convenience purposes. It has the downside
# of increasing the boot-up time by auto-requiring all fixtures in the support
# directory. Alternatively, in the individual `*_spec.rb` fixtures, manually
# require only the support fixtures necessary.

# Checks for pending migrations before tests are run.

  # You can disable this behaviour by removing the line below, and instead

  #
  #     RSpec.describe UsersController, :type => :controller do
  #       # ...
